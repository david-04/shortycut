Listing all issues https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues Performing a full-text search https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues?q=style Opening one specific issue https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/2163 Creating separate keywords allows to quickly navigate to the most suitable page on a case-by-case basis: shortycut.addShortcuts(` [mkdli] MkDocs \u00bb List issues https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues [mkdsi] MkDocs \u00bb Search issues https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues?q=%s [mkdgi] MkDocs \u00bb Goto issue https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/%s `); This provides great flexibility but also increases the number of keywords. From a usability point of view, it would be better to have only one keyword for all links: shortycut.addShortcuts(` [mkdi] MkDocs \u00bb Issues https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues [mkdi] MkDocs \u00bb Search issues https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues?q=%s [mkdi] MkDocs \u00bb Goto issue https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/%s `); ShortyCut distinguishes between bookmarks and queries. Bookmarks are static links like the issue listing - they always open the same page. Queries, on the other hand, contain the %s placeholder and require a search term. Both types can share the same keyword. If entered on its own, ShortyCut would use the bookmark. If the keyword is accompanied by a search term, the query would be used instead. In the above example, using only mkdi would open the issue listing, because that's the only bookmark for the keyword. But if a search term was entered as well, two queries (search issues and goto issue) would match. Depending on the configuration, ShortyCut would either open both links in separate tabs or display a list to manually choose from. Dynamic links avoid opening multiple tabs or having to choose from a list. They analyze the search term and automatically select the most suitable target page. Creating dynamic links Dynamic links are simple JavaScript functions. They receive the search term as a parameter and return the applicable link as the result: function mkDocsIssues(searchTerm) { if (searchTerm.trim().match(/^[0-9]+$/)) { return 'https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/%s'; } else { return 'https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues?q=%s'; } } The search term is passed in as regular text (i.e. not URL-encoded). Before embedding it into a link, it needs to be passed through encodeURIComponent() . However, it's easier to just return a link with the %s placeholder and let ShortyCut insert the search term. The next step is to register the function: var mkDocsIssuesUrl = shortycut.toUrl(mkDocsIssues); This generates a virtual link, which can be used like any other link when defining shortcuts: shortycut.addShortcuts(` [mkdi] MkDocs \u00bb Issues https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues [mkdi] MkDocs \u00bb Issues ${ mkDocsIssuesUrl } `); Interpolation with ${ and } only works for backtick (multi-line) strings. When using the legacy syntax for older browsers, the variable must be appended instead: shortycut.addShortcuts([ '[mkdi] MkDocs \u00bb Issues https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues', '[mkdi] MkDocs \u00bb Issues' + mkDocsIssuesUrl ]); With these shortcuts in place, there's only keyword to remember. Depending on the search term (if any), it opens the right page straight away. Favicons ShortyCut shows favicons on its homepage, if the configuration property showFavicons is set to true : For dynamic links, ShortyCut selects the favicon based on a sample URL, which it retrieves by passing the following search terms to the dynamic link function: undefined null '' (empty string) '1' (as a string) Exceptions are discarded silently and the first valid URL returned is used to determine the favicon. Although usually not needed, a preferred domain can be nominated by returning a corresponding link when the search term is null or undefined : function mkDocsIssues(searchTerm) { if (undefined === searchTerm) { return 'https://www.mkdocs.org/'; } if (searchTerm.trim().match(/^[0-9]+$/)) { return 'https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues/%s'; } else { return 'https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/issues?q=%s'; } } This dynamic link redirects all queries to one of two GitHub pages, but uses the favicon of MkDoc's homepage (rather than the one from GitHub).

For example, they might be composed of the first letter of each word, like tg for \" T yping G ames\". The automatic highlighting does not consider those rules and highlights the wrong g . To work around this problem, hotkeys can be explicitly marked when defining shortcuts. This is done by putting a designated symbol in front of each hotkey within the description. Any symbol can be used, but it must be configured as hotkeyMarker first: shortycut.configure({ shortcutFormat: { hotkeyMarker: '_' } }); In this example, the underscore ( _ ) can be used to mark the correct hotkeys: [tr] Translate https://dict.leo.org/ende?search=%s [ta] The Age https://www.theage.com.au/ [tg] _Typing _Games https://www.typing.com/student/game [tc] _Tech_Crunch https://techcrunch.com It's important that the hotkeys are aligned with the keyword. ShortyCut disregards markers if the letters don't match. On the other hand, there's no need to mark hotkeys if the automatic highlighting would pick the right ones anyway. ShortyCut uses the designed hotkeys where possible, and resorts to automatic highlighting in all other cases: The hotkey highlighting can be turned off by setting the configuration property showHotkeys to false .

For example, they might be composed of the first letter of each word, like tg for \" T yping G ames\". The automatic highlighting does not consider those rules and highlights the wrong g . To work around this problem, hotkeys can be explicitly marked when defining shortcuts. This is done by putting a designated symbol in front of each hotkey within the description. Any symbol can be used, but it must be configured as hotkeyMarker first: shortycut.configure({ shortcutFormat: { hotkeyMarker: '_' } }); In this example, the underscore ( _ ) can be used to mark the correct hotkeys: [tr] Translate https://dict.leo.org/ende?search=%s [ta] The Age https://www.theage.com.au/ [tg] _Typing _Games https://www.typing.com/student/game [tc] _Tech_Crunch https://techcrunch.com It's important that the hotkeys are aligned with the keyword.

To activate them, rename the data-template folder to data (i.e. remove the -template from the folder's name): shortycut +-- data-template <--- rename this folder from: data-template +-- resources to: data +-- index.html <------ then open this file in your browser After renaming the folder, open index.html in your browser (e.g. by double-clicking on it). If you see ShortyCut's homepage, the installation is complete. Customization After installing ShortyCut, you need to add your own links and keywords. This is done by editing shortcuts.js in the data folder. See \" Shortcut syntax \" for details. In order to use the keywords, you also need to make them available in your browser. The easiest way is to pin ShortyCut's homepage, but other methods are available, too. See \" Browser integration \" for details. ShortyCut can be customized by editing settings.js in the data folder. This includes enabling and disabling features as well as tweaking the way shortcuts are defined. See \" Configuration \" for details. Finally, browse through the other pages of the manual. They cover a variety of different aspects that will help you to make the most of ShortyCut. Upgrading When upgrading to a newer version, your shortcuts and settings are preserved.

Each of them takes effort (to find and click on the right link) and time (to wait for the next page to load). Navigating in small steps - one at a time - is neither efficient nor enjoyable. One example of click-intensive browsing is online shopping. Getting the most relevant results often requires multiple filters to be applied. Imagine you're in Australia and - with summer approaching fast - in urgent need of a nice (and cheap) pair of sunnies. To find suitable offers, you might go through a couple of steps: Open ebay.com.au (or use a search engine for lesser-known domains) Enter the term \"sunglasses\" into the search field Select the category \"men\" or \"women\" (to fit your style) Change the sort order to \"price\" (so that the cheapest offers appear on top) If not logged in, set the delivery location (to get the correct shipping rates) Deselect auctions (because you want to buy it now) Filter Australian offers only (to get it delivered as soon as possible) Customize further as required (e.g. free returns only or more results per page) Finding the perfect pair of sunglasses can be hard work.

This allows the customized view to be bookmarked. When revisiting the page, all filters are restored automatically. This can speed things up, but searching for the right bookmark takes time, too. That's where keywords come into play.

There's no need to step through intermediate pages, customize the listing or find the right bookmark. Keyword searches Keyword bookmarks are great for quickly restoring filters and directly accessing nested pages. But they're also kind of a one-trick pony and always produce the same page view. A more versatile form are keyword searches. They work with websites that allow searching for things like products, news, or images. Like filters and settings, the search term is usually included in the page's address: https://www.ebay.com.au/sch/i.html?_nkw=sunglasses&_from=R40&LH_PrefLoc=1 Once such a page has been bookmarked, it can be turned into a keyword search by replacing the original search term sunglasses with %s (which is as a special placeholder recognized by the browser): This bookmark allows searching for any product on eBay and is no longer limited to sunglasses. It's used by entering the keyword ( ebay ) followed by the search term (e.g. hat ) in the address bar: This will open eBay, restore all bookmarked filters, and search for hats. Limitations Keywords are incredibly handy. They bypass long-winded navigation steps, restore filter settings, and open the right page straight away. As a native browser feature, they do have some limitations, though. In Chromium-based browsers, for example, the usability is not great.

This can also be set as the default behavior in the configuration , causing ShortyCut to always open new tabs without showing the list first. On top of that, each shortcut can override the default behavior and enforce to either show the list or open new tabs. Show a list A question mark ( ? ) in front of links causes the keyword to always show the list: [news] News \u00bb Australia ?https://www.theage.com.au/national [news] News \u00bb Finance ?https://www.reuters.com/finance [news] News \u00bb Sports ?https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports [news] News \u00bb World ?https://www.bbc.com/news/world In this example, the news keyword will always show the list, even if the default behavior is set to open new tabs.

The news keyword is treated as if it had only one link (world news). It's the same effect as if the first three lines were not there at all. Ignoring previous links is rarely needed. It can be used to override individual keywords when importing shared shortcut collections. It can also be used to temporarily redirect or repurpose a keyword, without having to delete (and later restore) the current set of links.

It's usually easier to assign all related pages to the same keyword: [news] News \u00bb Australia https://www.theage.com.au/national [news] News \u00bb Finance https://www.reuters.com/finance [news] News \u00bb Sports https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports [news] News \u00bb World https://www.bbc.com/news/world When entering a keyword with multiple links, ShortyCut shows a list to choose from: The \"Open all\" item on top of the list can be used to open all links in new tabs. This can also be set as the default behavior in the configuration , causing ShortyCut to always open new tabs without showing the list first. On top of that, each shortcut can override the default behavior and enforce to either show the list or open new tabs.","title":"Multi-link shortcuts"},{"location":"multi-link-shortcuts.html#show-a-list","text":"A question mark ( ? ) in front of links causes the keyword to always show the list: [news] News \u00bb Australia ?https://www.theage.com.au/national [news] News \u00bb Finance ?https://www.reuters.com/finance [news] News \u00bb Sports ?https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports [news] News \u00bb World ?https://www.bbc.com/news/world In this example, the news keyword will always show the list, even if the default behavior is set to open new tabs.","title":"Show a list"},{"location":"multi-link-shortcuts.html#open-new-tabs","text":"A caret ( ^ ) in front of links causes the keyword to always open new tabs: [news] News \u00bb Australia ^https://www.theage.com.au/national [news] News \u00bb Finance ^https://www.reuters.com/finance [news] News \u00bb Sports ^https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports [news] News \u00bb World ^https://www.bbc.com/news/world In this example, the news keyword will always open new tabs, even if the default behavior is set to show the list.","title":"Open new tabs"},{"location":"multi-link-shortcuts.html#ignore-previous-links","text":"An equals sign ( = ) in front of a link causes all previous links to be discarded: [news] News \u00bb Australia ?https://www.theage.com.au/national [news] News \u00bb Finance ?https://www.reuters.com/finance [news] News \u00bb Sports ?https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports [news] News \u00bb World =https://www.bbc.com/news/world In this example, importing the last line will cause ShortyCut to discard all previous links. The news keyword is treated as if it had only one link (world news). It's the same effect as if the first three lines were not there at all. Ignoring previous links is rarely needed.
